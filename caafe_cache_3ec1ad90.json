By multiplying weekly hours by average session length, it captures both the frequency and depth of user interaction. A high value indicates a highly engaged user, which is often a strong negative predictor of churn. Conversely, a low value might signal a disengaged user at risk of churning. This interaction term can capture non-linear relationships that might be missed by using the two features independently, thus providing a more nuanced signal for the classification model.)\n# Input samples: ({'weekly_hours': [43.44, 41.22, 3.83], 'average_session_length': [87.02, 54.77, 51.09]})\ndf['engagement_intensity'] = df['weekly_hours'] * df['average_session_length']",
