A large range or variance across different sensor readings for a single wafer could indicate process instability or an anomaly that might lead to a defect. This feature aggregates information from multiple sensors into a single metric representing the overall process variability, which can be a powerful predictor of defect occurrence. A wider spread might signal a deviation from the optimal operating window.)\n# Input samples: ({'0': [3042.7, 3093.31, 2981.49], '1': [2355.11, 2456.82, 2536.82], '2': [2242.86, 2207.96, 2147.11], '15': [400.48, 405.63, 412.36]})\ndf['Sensor_Value_Range'] = df[['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '12', '14', '15', '16']].max(axis=1) - df[['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '12', '14', '15', '16']].min(axis=1)",

In semiconductor manufacturing, the ratio of certain process parameters (like temperatures, pressures, or flow rates, which these sensors might measure) can be a critical indicator of process stability and control. A deviation in this ratio, even if the individual sensor values are within their normal operating ranges, could signal an impending process excursion that leads to a defect. This engineered feature provides a more nuanced view of the process state than the raw sensor values alone, potentially improving the model's ability to detect subtle anomalies.)\n# Input samples: ({'15': [400.48, 405.63, 412.36], '16': [10.61, 10.0, 10.01]})\ndf['Sensor_Ratio_15_16'] = df['15'] / (df['16'] + 1e-6)",
